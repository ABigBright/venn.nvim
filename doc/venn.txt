                                └───┘           ┌───┐
                                                └───┘

======================================================

USAGE

1. `set virtualedit=all` or `set ve=all`. This will allow
you to freely move the cursor in the buffer. (see
|virtualedit|).

2. Enter in Visual Block mode using <C-v>. Select the
region where the box should be.

3. Invoke |:VBox|. This will draw a rectangle. In case, it
has a width or a height of 1, it will draw a line.

Notes:

To avoid switching to |virtualedit| everytime a text file is
opened, please use a vim directive. For example:
>
  vim:ve=all:
<
This should be the last line of the text file.
