venn offers utilities to easily draw ASCII diagrams which
would be difficult to do by hand.

                  Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

======================================================

EXAMPLES

The following diagrams were all drawn using venn. This shows
the possibilities offered by the plug-in.

                                └───┘           ┌───┐
                                                └───┘

======================================================

USAGE

1. `set virtualedit=all` or `set ve=all`. This will allow
you to freely move the cursor in the buffer. (see help
|virtualedit|).

2. Enter in Visual Block mode using <C-v>. Select the region
where the box should be.

3. Invoke |:VBox|. This will draw a rectangle. In case, it has
a width or a height of 1, it will draw a line.

======================================================

COMMANDS

                                                *:VBox*
:VBox                     
                Draw a single line border where the visual
                block area was selected. If the width or
                height is 1, draw an arrow instead.
